# PHP Model View Controller (MVC)

Sample example of PHP MVC. It is like a tutorial and follows the tutorial ["Simple MVC in PHP"](#references) provided by howCode at YouTube, but it is updated and __compatible with PHP 8.1__. Also some other features are added. However, despite it is little bit outdated, I strongly recommend you to watch the tutorial ["Simple MVC in PHP"](#references) which is just 20 minutes long.

The branches are named `Stage-X...` and they represent the consequential steps that lead to the final state. In the following sections of this read-me are provided the reverences about certain things I've researched while studying this technique.

## Create database

In the directory [`assets/sql`](assets/sql/) are available two manual like SQL files. We can suppress the comments and use them as SQL scrips to create or remove the `sample_db` MySQL database used in this tutorial.

```bash
sed -r '/^(-- |$)/d' sample_db_create.sql | sudo mysql
sed -r '/^(-- |$)/d' sample_db_remove.sql | sudo mysql
```

According to the documentation these comments shouldn't make a problem, but in my case the do.

## Tweak .htaccess

The example provided in the beginning of the tutorial [Simple MVC in PHP (1/4) - Routing](https://youtu.be/DpbUqJcch0Y) is incomplete, because sometimes we need to change some other options and also to serve some static files and avoid unnecessary additional processing. In the first section of the current [.htaccess](./.htaccess) file some of these requirements are covered.

## Auto load Classes

`__autoload()` is no longer supported, use `spl_autoload_register()` instead.

```log
[Fri Sep 30 13:26:51.015401 2022] [proxy_fcgi:error] [pid 2629300] [client 192.168.1.110:41546] AH01071: Got error 'PHP message: PHP Fatal error:  __autoload() is no longer supported, use spl_autoload_register() instead in /var/www/php-mvc.example.com/index.php on line 16'
```

The relevant code of [Simple MVC in PHP (1/4) - Routing](https://youtu.be/DpbUqJcch0Y) should be changed to:

```php
spl_autoload_register(function($class) {
    include 'classes/' . $class . '.php';
});
```

## Install and setup Node.js and NPM

I'm using few tools to transpile and uglify/minify the CSS and JS resources. All of them are available at NPM. Install the latest version of NPM and Node.js on Ubuntu/Debian machine.

```bash
sudo apt install npm
sudo npm install n
sudo n latest
node -v; npm -v # In a new terminal window 
```

Initialize the project and fetch the necessary packages. (The following steps are already done. So skip to the next section.)

```bash
npm init
npm i @babel/cli @babel/core @babel/plugin-transform-regenerator @babel/plugin-transform-spread @babel/preset-env
npm i uglify-js
npm i less less-plugin-clean-css
npm i onchange
npm i jquery jquery.easing
```

The above few commands will create `package.json`, install few NPM packages. Once this is done, no new instance you just need to to run the following command and everything will installed and ready to use (a new file `package-lock.json` and directory `node_modules` will appear; the `--save-dev` option is intentionally not used).

```bash
npm install
cp -v node_modules/less/dist/* assets/vendor/
cp -v node_modules/jquery/dist/*.min.js assets/vendor/
cp -v node_modules/jquery.easing/jquery.*.js assets/vendor/
```

[`package.json`](package.json) provide few "scrips". You can use them from the CLI in the following way.

```bash
npm run babel     # assets/js/src/*.es6.js -> assets/js/dist/*.es5.js
npm run uglifyjs  # assets/js/dist/*.js    -> assets/js/dist/*.min.js
npm run lessc     # assets/css/src/*.less  -> assets/css/dist/*.min.css
npm run clean     # remove the content of the 'dist/' directories
npm run build     # run all commands above
npm run watch     # run the 'build' command by the help of 'onchange' when the files in 'src/' are changed.
```
